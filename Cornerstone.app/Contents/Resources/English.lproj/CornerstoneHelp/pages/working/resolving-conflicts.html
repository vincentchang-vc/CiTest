  <h1>Resolving Conflicts</h1>
  <p>Conflicts occur when a file that contains local modifications is updated with overlapping changes from the latest version in the repository.</p>
  <p>Conflicted files can't be committed until the conflicts have been resolved.</p>
  
  <h2>Resolving Individual Conflicts</h2>
  <p>A conflicted text file contains markers inserted by Subversion that identify the local and remote changes:</p>
  <p><img class="screenshot" src="../../images/conflicted-text.png"/></p>
  <p>In this example, the section beginning with <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine</code> on line 23 contains the local change from the working version. The code on line 25 is the change from the latest version in the repository (marked as revision <code>.r2839</code>).</p>
  <p>To resolve the conflict:</p>
  
  <div class="box task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>Accept or reject each modification, conferring with the team member responsible for the conflicting change. Non-trivial conflicts may require significant re-implementation of the local changes to resolve.</li>
  		<li>Mark the conflict as resolved using <span class="uiref">Working Copy &gt; Resolve Conflicts</span> (key equivalent <span class="key">âŒ˜K</span>) or click the <span class="uiref">Resolve</span> button in the view's toolbar:
  		<p><img src="../../images/toolbar-resolve.png"/></p>
  		</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  
  <p>Once resolved, the file is marked as modified and the changes can be committed like any other modification.</p>
  
  <h2>Opening Conflict Files</h2>
  <p>When a conflicted file is selected in the browser, the following toolbar buttons are displayed in the view's toolbar:</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/toolbar-conflict.png"/></p>
  <p>These buttons can be used to compare the various file versions relevant to the conflict against the merged working version.</p>
  
  <p>The <span class="uiref">Open</span> button in the view's toolbar also gains a popup menu:</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/toolbar-open-conflict.png"/></p>
  <p>Clicking and holding the <span class="uiref">Open</span> button will display a popup menu allowing you to select which of the HEAD, BASE, .mine and merged (i.e. working) versions should be opened.</p>
  
  <h2>Resolving Conflicts on a File-by-File Basis</h2>
  <p>Sometimes you may be able to resolve all the conflicts in a file given the knowledge, for example, that the changes implemented by one team member will take precedence over another's.</p>
  <p>The conflict bar makes it easy to resolve a file to a particular revision:</p>
  
  <div class="box task">
  	<ol>
  		<li>Select the version of the file you wish to resolve to from the popup menu on the right-hand side of the bar.</li>
  		<li>Click and hold the <span class="uiref">Resolve</span> button in the view's toolbar.</li>
  		<li>Select a revision to resolve to (HEAD, BASE, .mine or working/merged) from the popup menu displayed.</li>
  	</ol>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Resolving Conflicts with an External Compare Tool</h2>
  <p>Cornerstone also provides support for using external compare tools to resolve conflicts. See the dedicated <a href="../integration/external-compare-tools.html#resolving-conflicts">topic</a> in the <a href="../integration/index.html">Integration</a> section for more information.</p>
